    "summary": "Summarize and describe this idea: So, my idea is to buia model that can predict the trades. This model will be based on an ensemble of algorithms. In this model, every algorithm will be trained on a different dataset. And the final prediction will be made by taking the average of the predictions of all the algorithms. I will use this model to predict the trades of the stock market. I will use a variety of datasets to train the algorithms. These datasets will include historical data, news articles, and social media posts related to the stock market. And I will use a variety of algorithms, including regression, classification, and clustering algorithms. The final model will be trained on the combined datasets and will be able to predict the trades of the stock market. [end of text]"

    "summary": "Summarize and describe this idea: So, my idea is a keychain with built-in NFC to share your contact instantly. Imagine if you could share your contact list with anyone you meet at a networking event, a new restaurant or a conference. All they have to do is tap it and voila! Your contact list is now on their phone. My idea is to create a sleek and modern design, which makes it look like a regular keychain with a small button on it. When someone taps that button, it sends an NFC signal to their phone with the contact list. The keychain would be made of metal to give it durability and longevity. I would also add a small QR code on the back of the keychain, so people can easily find my company online. [end of text]"

    "summary": "Summarize and describe this idea: My idea is to sell homemade cookies on the app.\n [BLANK_AUDIO]\n\nThis idea involves selling homemade cookies through an app. The seller would create and bake the cookies, then take pictures and list them for sale on the app. Customers would browse through the available options, place an order, and make a payment through the app. The seller would then deliver or ship the cookies to the customer. This could be a part-time or full-time business, depending on the scale of operation. Overall, it's a simple yet profitable idea that requires minimal startup costs and can be run from home.
